# Remote Inference for Microcontrollers at the Edge.

# Abstract

The goal of this project is to investigate the performance of using edge servers to provide deep neural network inference on data gathered by embedded microcontrollers. Three setups for providing neural net inferences to an Arduino are tested. One using just the Arduino, one using the Arduino and a Coral Dev Board, and one using the Arduino and a PC. Data is transferred from the Arduino to an edge server through BLE. The application used to benchmark the systems is human activity recognition using acceleromater and gyroscope data. Data processing and neural net inference times are reduced significantly when offloading however the communication overhead makes these benefits negligible.
