# Remote Inference for Microcontrollers at the Edge.

# Abstract

*Provide a brief overview of the project objhectives, approach, and results.*

The goal of this project is to evaluate the effectiveness of using a networked tensor processing unit to improve the effectiveness of machine learning results on embedded devices. The system will consist of the sensing device, anArduino Nano 33 BLE Sense, and the edge server, a Coral Dev Board TPU. The performance of a ML model running on only the device using TinyML practices will be compared to running inference remotely on the edge server. The models to be used for evaluation are the DeepConvLSTM running on the edge server and the device will run traditional ML models such as SVM. The metrics used to gauge performance will be accuracy, latency, and power consumption.
